VBA Module 2 Challenge: Stock Market Analysis
Overview
This project entails analyzing market data for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 using VBA scripting. The script iterates through each worksheet to calculate various metrics for each stock, including the ticker symbol, yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume. Additionally, the script identifies stocks with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".

Methodology
Metrics Calculated
Ticker Symbol: Identifies the stock.
Yearly Change: Calculates the difference between the opening price at the beginning of a given year and the closing price at the end of that year.
Percentage Change: Determines the percentage change from the opening price to the closing price.
Total Stock Volume: Computes the total volume of the stock traded.
Script Functionality
The script is designed to:

Loop through each worksheet to analyze data for multiple years.
Calculate metrics for each stock on every worksheet.
Identify stocks with the highest percentage increase, decrease, and total volume.
Acknowledgments
Tutor Assistance: Collaborated with a tutor to develop calculations for yearly and percentage changes.
Online Resources: Utilized YouTube tutorials and online forums for guidance on adapting the script to analyze multiple worksheets.
ASKBCS Learning Assistant: Received support in scripting functionality to identify stocks with the greatest percentage changes and total volume.
Results
The analysis results are depicted in the provided images.
