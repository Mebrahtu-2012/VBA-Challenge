VBA Module 2 Challenge

This project is to analyze the market data for the years 2018, 2019, and 2019. The script will loop through all the worksheets and calculate the given instructions: 
•	The ticker symbol
•	Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
•	The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
•	The total stock volume of the stock.
•	Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 
•	Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) at once.

I worked with a tutor to formulate the yearly change and the percentage change calculation. I looked up how to appropriate adjustments to the VBA script to run on every worksheets on YouTube. Also, ASKBCS Learning Assistant helped me with scripting the greatest % increase and from there I was able to calculate the greatest % decrease and the greatest total volume. 
The results are as follow
